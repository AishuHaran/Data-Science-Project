|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Assignment Pandas & Seaborn**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Assignment%20Pandas%20%26%20Seaborn.ipynb) | Explored the Titanic and Pokemon dataset using Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization. Focused on data cleaning and EDA techniques. | Identified data inconsistencies and visualized survival trends by sex, age, and class effectively for Titanic passengers and identified which Pokémon types have the highest average stats and the number of legendary Pokémon in the dataset. | Strengthened skills in data manipulation and visual storytelling, applying charting techniques to convey insights. |
| [**Capstone Project**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Capstone%20Project.ipynb) | Applied machine learning models, including clustering and predictive analysis, to solve a real-world business problem. | Discovered customer segments using clustering and predicted sales outcomes based on historical data. | Developed critical thinking for feature engineering and model evaluation. |
| [**Coffee Chain Sales Performance Analysis**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Coffee%20Chain%20Sales%20Performance%20Analysis) | Analyzed a coffee chain's sales data to identify profit drivers and growth opportunities. | Found key profitability drivers and potential untapped markets. | Learned to build actionable dashboards using Tableau and improve data storytelling skills. |
| [**Movie Recommender System**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System.ipynb) | Built a recommendation system to suggest movies based on user preferences using collaborative filtering techniques. | Improved movie recommendations by optimizing filtering algorithms. | Strengthened knowledge in machine learning models, specifically collaborative filtering. |
| [**Project SQL Detective**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Project%20SQL%20Detective.ipynb) | Solved a mystery involving the theft of a duck statue using SQL to query various tables from a SQLite database. Tasks included analyzing crime scene reports, ATM transactions, security logs, and phone records to identify the thief and their accomplice. | Combined clues from crime scene data, flight records, ATM transactions, and security logs to uncover the criminal’s identity and accomplice. | Strengthened SQL querying skills for complex investigations, developed a systematic approach for solving real-world problems, and learned to cross-reference data from multiple sources. |
